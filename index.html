					<p>
						Oct 2021
						<br><br>
						PJ Ramen Shop is a ramen-customization simulator that I created in a team of two
						in the span of five days. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the web app,
						as well as Adobe Illustrator and Autodesk Sketchbook for the graphics. This project
						won 2nd place in ICSSC's WebJam, which you can read about 
						<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=2058" target="_blank">here</a>!

					</a>
					<p>
						Jan 2021 - Mar 2021
						<br><br>
						Dogs vs Cats is a tower defense game made using C++ and SFML. I collaborated with
						four teammates for this project, learning how to use GitHub in the process.
						I primarily focused on designing the UI, programming the main menu, and creating the
						sprites and their animations while implementing them into the game.

						<br><br>
						Grow is a work in progress. It is a minigame that will allow you to
						take care of a plant and watch it grow into something unexpected. I am currently
						developing it in my free time, using React (which I am learning). 
						Although it is still unfinished, feel free to take a look!

			<h3>Software Engineering Intern at Juniper Networks</h3>
			<p>
				Jun 2022 - Sep 2022
				<br><br>
				I was a SWE intern at Juniper Networks in Summer 2022. I joined the UI/UX
				development team and worked to analyse and solve issues regarding a component library
				built with React, TypeScript, and Less CSS. I used tools such as Visual Studio Code,
				Storybook, and Chrome Dev Tools, and I also learned testing with Jest. During my time here,
				I collaborated with teammates using software such as JIRA and GitLab. I also presented
				demos of my work, regularly participated in standup meetings, and joined sprint planning 
				sessions. Beyond my work, I also got to meet lots of other interns, which I am super
				grateful for.
